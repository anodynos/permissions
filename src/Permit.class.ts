  It already has the `user` & `resource` baked in, so we only need to pass `resourceId`.

  __Notes__

   If the User has no "own" grant for the Action against the Resource, it still makes sense to call it:

   ```js
    {
      roles: ['EMPLOYEE'],
      isOwner: async (resourceId) => [1,2,3].includes(resourceId),
      grant: {
       'read:any': ['id', 'title'],
       'read:own': ['id', 'title', 'confidential'],
      }
    }
   ```

  and we request a `Permit` for `EMPLOYEE read document`, we should still be able to know which documents are OWN cause we might want to _.pick:

   - ANY document with any `['id', 'title']`

   - OWN documents with `['id', 'title', 'confidential']`, a permission we obtained from the `read:own` grant

  @param resourceId The ID of the resource, eg `123`
  */

      if (
        await isOwner({
          user: this.user,
          resourceId,
        })
      )
        return true;

    return false;
  }

  /**
   Returns an array of the `resourceIds` owned by the User, that can be used to filter the resource items the User can act on.

   __How to Use__

   In your app, you can do something like:

   ```typescript
      const ownedDocumentIds = await permit.listOwn();
      const query = `SELECT FROM document WHERE document.id in (${ownedDocumentIds.join(',')})`; // but if using Postgres/TypeORM be careful of issues like https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2195#issuecomment-492991247)
   ```

   Note: the difference between `Permit::listOwn` and `PermissionDefinition::listOwned`:

     `Permit::listOwn` is a dynamically composed function of the potentially different `isOwner` functions attached to different `PermissionsDefinitions` that apply to this User.

   The composed function calls all the `listOwned` found for the user & __returns the UNION of all resourceIds__.

   __Notes__

   a) When `anyGranted = true`

   If `anyGranted` is true we usually expect the app to NOT filter the resources, since our User can access all documents. It is the  responsibility of the userland's app, to check for `permit.anyGranted === true` and to avoid applying filtering on the DB query etc.

   BUT `listOwn()` might still make sense, in case we want to handle differently user's own documents. In this case, if no `listOwned` is defined, it returns an empty [].

   b) The `listOwn()` callback that returns a list of own ids is not scalable, if we potentially have too many (eg hundred thousand or millions) of owned resourceIds for a user and it could break the service (i.make it too slow).

   The reason is that the callback is required to prefetch ALL ids of the resource owned by that user (in memory) and then probably use them to build an "IN (...ownedIds)" type query. And usually the service will go ahead and fetch only a small subset of those (eg a page of 10 or 50 resources).

   For these reasons, you should use the `limitOwn()` hook - see below. Also in the near future, this hook will probably be DEPRECATED.
  */
  public async listOwn(): Promise<TResourceId[]> {
    if (!this.grantedAction)
      throw new Error(
        'SA-Permissions: `permit.listOwn()` called but permit.grantedAction is false'
      );

    if (!this.isListOwnSupported())
      throw new Error(
        'SA-Permissions: `permit.listOwn()` called but its not supported for this Permit'
      );

    const ownIds: TResourceId[] = [];
    for (const listOwned of this._listOwneds) {
      const resourceIds = await listOwned(this.user);
      ownIds.push(...resourceIds);

  /**
   Configures the actual __query__ (or generates the __filter__) used to fetch the data from the data layer (eg the DB), using the conditions/restrictions imposed by the roles of the user, as these are defined in `limitOwned` ownership hooks in `PermissionDefinitions`.

   The purpose of `limitOwn` is to allow the filtering of resources owned by the User __lazily__ - in contrast with `listOwn()` which aggressively fetches all owned resourceIds of the User.

   In other words, it configures (OR successively builds) a __filter__ or __query__, but doesn't actually perform the filtering it self. Think of it as composing a function to pass to `Array.filter` or adding some `orWhere` clauses to an ORM query, but not actually executing the query.

   It is agnostic of the ORM/DB engine used. This can work by passing an arbitrary `context` value (can be an Object, Array or any other accumulator of your choice) that holds the successive clauses, predicates etc of the owned restrictions defined as `limitOwned` hooks. For example the `context` in TypeORM could be a the `query` or a `subquery` object, before it has been executed.

   __Note__: the difference between `Permit::limitOwn` and `PermissionDefinition::limitOwned`: The `Permit::limitOwn` is a dynamically composed function of the potentially different `PermissionDefinition::limitOwned` functions attached to different `PermissionsDefinitions` that apply to this User (based on the roles user carries).

   By default, to reduce all `PermissionDefinition::limitOwned` together, it calls all unique `limitOwned` functions found for the user, passing the `user` and the `context` value at each call and retrieving `context` back as the accumulator of that call.   Finally it returns the resulting `context` value, whatever that might be. You can change this behavior, by using your own `limitOwnReduce`, passed at the Permissions constructor.

  __Considerations__

   - You must construct your `limitOwned` functions in the `PermissionsDefinitions`, using __OR logic__ of the WHERE clauses or predicates, instead of an __AND logic__.

     This is because for example a User that has both `EMPLOYEE` and `EMPLOYEE_MANAGER` roles, the resulting query should include all `EMPLOYEE_MANAGER` plus the `EMPLOYEE` filtered items (i.e their __union__).

     If our subquery was build with __AND logic__, then only the items that satisfy both constraints would be filtered (ie. their __intersection__).

   - You must accumulate the existing `context` value(s), in the `context` value than you return from each `limitOwned` hook and then perhaps compose the final one from the `context` returned from the `limitOwn` call.

   Depending on the context you choose, you may provide __your own__ `limitOwn()` version by passing a `limitOwnReduce` in the `Permissions` constructor - see below.

   A TypeORM `query` object is the ideal context & use case for the default reduce logic of `limitOwn`. The `query` accumulates all calls to `andWhere` etc in its own self. Assuming a TypeORM app, with `PermissionDefinitions` like

   ```js
     [
       {
         ...
         roles: 'RoleA'
         limitOwned: (user, query) => query.orWhere(`"someField" = '${user.someField}'`);
       },
       {
         ...
         roles: 'RoleB'
         limitOwned: (user, query) => query.orWhere(`"otherField" = '${user.otherField}'`);
       }
     ]
   ```

   you can simply do something like this in you app's code:

   ```js
   query.andWhere(new Brackets(qb => permit.limitOwn(qb)));
   ```
   hence for a User with both RoleA & RoleB the resulting query will be augmented with a WHERE clause like

   ```sql
   SELECT ...fields... FROM resource
   WHERE ...existing where clauses....
   AND ("someField" = 'someValue' OR "otherField" = 'otherValue') -- <<< the WHERE clause augmented by limitOwn()
   ```

   But if you were returning a function predicate, make sure your return something that accumulates the existing ones in the `context` and in the final call you take all into account.

   There are many ways to achieve this, like functional composition or a simple collection, with or without context and with or without using `limitOwnReduce`.

   See [Example 5 with lodash & context and Example 6 for an even simpler one](/additional-documentation/detailed-usage-&-examples.html).
